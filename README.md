# BHVideoProcessor

## Description

This is just a simple demonstration of how you would use AVFoundation to stitch multiple videos together. In the example, add videos to the list and tap export. The stitcher will then validate that the videos exist and export the videos to a file in a temporary directory on the device. The stitched video is then saved to the photo library.
